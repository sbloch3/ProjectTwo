#Use input() to get the number of miles from the user. And store
#that int in a variable called miles.
miles = int(input("How many miles would you like to convert?"))

#Convert miles to yards, using the following:
# 1 mile = 1760 yards.
#
miles = int(input("1 mile = 1760 yards"))

#Store the value in a variable called yards and print it out with a 
#simple statement.
yards = 1760
print(yards)

#Convert miles to feet, using the following:
# 1 mile = 5280 feet.
#
miles = int(input("1 mile = 5280 feet"))

#Store the value in a variable called feet and print it out with a 
#simple statement.
feet = 5280
print(feet)
#Convert miles to inches, using the following:
# 1 mile = 63,360 inches.
#
miles = int(input("1 mile = 63,360 inches"))

#Store the value in a variable called inches and print it out with a 
#simple statement.
inches = 63,360
print(inches)
